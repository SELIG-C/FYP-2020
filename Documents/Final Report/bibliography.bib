  abstract = {Abstract The time-honored topic of fully developed wind seas pioneered by Pierson and Moskowitz is revisited to review the asymptotic evolution limits of integral spectral parameters used by the modeling community in the validation of wind-wave models. Discrepancies are investigated between benchmark asymptotic limits obtained by scaling integral spectral parameters using alternative wind speeds. Using state-of-the-art wind and wave modeling technology, uncertainties in the Pierson–Moskowitz limits due to inhomogeneities in the wind fields and contamination of the original data by crossing seas and swells are also investigated. The resulting reanalyzed database is used to investigate the optimal scaling wind parameter and to refine the levels of the full-development asymptotes of nondimensional integral wave spectral parameters used by the wind-wave modeling community. The results are also discussed in relation to recent advances in quantifying wave-breaking probability of wind seas. The results show that the parameterization of integral spectral parameters and the scaling of nondimensional asymptotes as a function of U10 yields relations consistent with similarity theory. On the other hand, expressing integral spectral parameters and scaling nondimensional asymptotes as a function of u∗ or alternative proposed scaling wind speeds yields relations that do not conform to similarity requirements as convincingly. The reanalyzed spectra are used to investigate parameter values and shapes of analytical functions representing fully developed spectra. These results support an analytical form with a spectral tail proportional to f−4.},

  abstract = {The data for the spectrums of fully developed seas obtained by Moskowitz [1964] for wind speeds from 20 to 40 knots (10.29 to 20.58 m/sec), are used to test the similarity hypothesis and the idea proposed by Kitaigorodskii [1961] that, when plotted in a certain dimensionless way, the power spectrums for all fully developed seas should be of the same shape. Over the important range of frequencies that define the total variance of the spectrum within a few per cent, the transformed plots yield a nondimensional spectral form that is nearly the same over this entire range of wind speeds within the present accuracies of the data. However, since slight variations of the wind speed have large effects on the location of this nondimensional spectral form, inaccuracies in the determination of the wind speed at sea allow for some latitude in the final choice of the form of the spectrum. Also, since the winds used to obtain the nondimensional form were measured at a height greater than 10 meters, the problem of relating the spectral form to a standard anemometer height arises. The variability introduced by this factor needs to be considered. The results, when errors in the wind speed, the sampling variability of the data, and the anemometer heights are considered, suggest a spectral form that is a compromise between the various proposed spectrums and that has features similar to many of them. A spectral form is recommended for tentative application to the problem of wave forecasting by spectral techniques. Improved wind speed measurements (taken at several elevations and averaged over longer time intervals) and better wave data (taken for longer time intervals and analyzed so as to better fit the procedures) are needed so that the form of the spectrums of fully developed wind seas and seas limited by either fetch or duration can be determined with even greater precision.},

The diversity of all metocean aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces is presented and how these impact drilling operations.

Facets of deepwater remoteness, water depth, winds, waves, tides, currents, solitons, ice, riser, time, and trouble-time management causes are emphasized. Environmental and ecosystems considerations are defined. A section condenses and considers all metocean elements in the context of deepwater drilling and how all best fit to assure safe, trouble-free drilling, station keeping, riser management, operational plans, and emergency response events can result. A review of metocean lost time analysis (supported by case studies) presenting evident elements concludes how teams can reduce and prevent metocean loss in future deepwater projects.},
