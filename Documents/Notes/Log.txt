I can make the float smash into the platform, so that's nice. 
Just have to whack the damping constant way up in the passive model.
Turning it down actually stops the simulation from running for some reason.

As a guess if it goes too far above the surface the kinematics must completely 
break down as centre of mass =/= centre of buoyancy in that case.

Think the constraint thing can't be explained by centre of buoyancy stuff. 
Errors indicate nastier bugs than that. At the end of the simulation the
graphs that are automatically produced throw errors and go unlabeled/non-existant.
Seems to be an issue with how 'legend' is used, could be a versioning issue.
